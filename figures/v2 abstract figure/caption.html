<div data-label="384400">depicts results from pilot experiments. A group of freely schooling three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) were outfitted with barcodes and tracked in a 1.2x1.2m tank. (a) shows the output from the barcode tracking software. Reliable tracks with consistently assigned identities are obtained. (b) shows the autocorrelation in an individual’s direction of motion. This allows us to determine the timescale of the system which allows us to get a time varying leadership network from the cross-correlation method described in Nagy et al. (2010). (c) depicts the results of the cross correlational analysis when the entire duration of the experiment is time averaged. Each line represents the leader-follower relationship between a fish pair. The value of  determines which individual in the pair is the leader and which is the follower. Eventually, using a sliding window of size determined by the autocorrelation will allow us to get a time varying leadership network.</div>
