<div>Fish use visual cues to coordinate behavior during schooling motion, search and find food sources, and spread information about predation threats through the group. Previous work has demonstrated the efficacy of visual networks in predicting the spread of information cascades through the group&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Strandburg_Peshkin_2013,Rosenthal_2015}</cite>. However, the time-dependent structure of how individuals exchange information within a group, and how this  affects motion and decision-abilities, are not well understood. We use time-dependent interaction and response networks in schools of fish to examine hierarchy within the group and to determine the relationship between structural networks, which are obtained via field field reconstruction and metric quantities, to functional networks, which are obtained by correlations in movements. &nbsp;Laboratory experiments with small schooling fish (three-spined stickleback,&nbsp;<i>species name</i>) in different sized groups are used to construct time-dependent visual, distance, and correlation networks, and these results are compared to model simulations of collective motion. &nbsp;This analysis reveals general features of communication network structure of an actively moving animal group, and provides a framework to analyse such networks in other contexts of collective behavior.</div><div>Interactions in animal groups are often represented by proximity networks. &nbsp;However, depending on species and context, this may be a poor approximation of information exchange&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Farine_2015}</cite>. &nbsp;A more accurate representation of possible communication routes can be obtained via visual field reconstruction&nbsp;<cite class="ltx_cite raw v1">\cite{Strandburg_Peshkin_2013,Rosenthal_2015}</cite>. &nbsp;This approach reveals the 'structural' network, i.e. what communication routes m how individuals may be effectively</div>
